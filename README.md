# The Store
The store is the platform where you can use your well earned coolcoins to buy certain events. 
The store items do not have any material value they represent activities or events that enhance the Codecool experience. 
The store offers two type of items basic and extra (magic). Basic items are meant for individual buyers while extra items are designed to be purchased by a group of students. 
Assortment and prices can be changed at the beggining of week, depending on demand and supply.
